# Exploring the Lorenz System with Machine Learning
---
## Project Overview
This project explores the behavior of the Lorenz system, a set of ordinary differential equations that exhibit chaotic solutions for certain parameters and initial conditions. The system is studied numerically, and machine learning (ML) models are applied to solve simple tasks aimed at gaining insights into the model's behavior. Visualizations and animations are used as visual aids and also to verify model performance.

The physics behind the Lorenz system is simple enough that the output of different models can be easily interpreted, yet complex enough to make it interesting to work with. The ultimate goal is to learn how to develop and deploy simple ML models to gain deeper insights into this fascinating physical system! 

## Key Features (In Development):
*  Numerical solutions of the Lorenz system. (*Implemented*)
*  Visualizations of time series and trajectory in 2D and 3D space. (*Implemented*)
*  3D animated plots. (*Partially Implemented; improvements planned*)
*  Polynomial regression models for predicting future states. (*Basic model implemented; further model enhancements in progress*)
*  Machine learning pipeline for feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation. (*Under development; feature engineering and advanced models to be added*)
